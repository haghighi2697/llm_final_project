       "\"It's never too late to get lifeguard certification, as there are no specific upper age limits for becoming a lifeguard, provided you meet the necessary physical and skill requirements. Most certification programs, like those offered by the American Red Cross or YMCA, have minimum age requirements (usually around 15 or 16 years old), but they welcome students of all ages beyond that.\\n\\nIf you're interested in becoming a certified lifeguard, check for local classes and certification courses in your area. These courses are typically offered throughout the year, although the schedule can vary based on location and demand. As long as you can pass the physical tests and complete the training, you can become certified.\""
