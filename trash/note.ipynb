When you file a claim on your own policy, the insurance company must\\nmeet these deadlines:\\nWithin 15 days after you file a claim: The company must let you know they received your\\nclaim. The company must also start their investigation and ask you for any other information\\nthey need.\\nWithin 15 business days after they get all the information they need: The company must\\napprove or deny your claim in writing. They can extend this deadline up to 45 days from the\\ndate they: (a) let you know they need more time and (b) tell you why.\\nWithin 5 business days after they let you know your claim is approved : The company must\\npay the claim.\\nNote: TDI can extend these deadlines by 15 more days if there is a weather-related catastrophe.\\nIf your company fails to meet these deadlines, you may be able to collect the claim amount, interest, and\\nattorney’s fees.\\n6.Written explanation of claim denial.
